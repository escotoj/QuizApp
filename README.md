# Quizz Application
The assigment is to create a multiple choice quiz that is timed. 
Using HTML, CSS but mainly working with JS to target classes, attributes and IDs.
## Progress
So far have created the layout and structure of the quiz including questions and starter code.
Worked with Johnny (TA) to target the correct classes and ids to render the first question. also got better guidance on how to work the logic for this app.
